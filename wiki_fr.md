== Résumé ==
Les joueurs sont des fermiers. Ils vont chercher les vaches au champ et les rassemblent en troupeaux pour les rentrer dans leur étable. Mais certaines vaches sont entourées de mouches, et chacun essaie de les éviter...

== But du jeu ==
Avoir le moins de mouches dans son étable lorsque la partie prend fin.

== Matériel ==
49 cartes réparties de la façon suivante :
* 15 cows, numbered from 1 to 15, without any flies
* 13 cows, numbered from 2 to 14, with 1 fly
* 11 cows, numbered from 3 to 13, with 2 flies
* 3 cows, numbered 7, 8 and 9, with 3 flies
* 6 cows, with 5 flies and a superpower
* 1 MOW card showing the direction of play

== Game Play ==
A game is played over several rounds

At the beginiing of each round, shuffle the 48 cow cards and deal five to each farmer.

The farmer with the most flies starts the round (in the first round, the youngest player starts).

He puts the MOW card arrow in front of him, pointing to the player on his left (the arrow shows the direction of play).

== Player actions ==
In hist turn, a player must :
# Add a cow to the herd
# Draw a card

=== 1. Add a cow to the herd ===
During his turn, each farmer MUST add a cow to the herd at either end of the line.

The farmer who places the first cow can choose any number. Subsequent cows must be numbered higher or lower than all the cows already in the herd.

Example :

If the card on the table are 3, 9 and 11, you can add a cow whose number is less than 3 (0, 1 or 2) or greater than 11 (12, 13, 14, 15 or 16).

==== Special cows ====
* Blocker: Play this cow to close off one end of the line.
* Acrobatic cow: Play this cow on another cow with the same number, no matter where it is in the line (this card cannot be played unless the requisite cow has been played previously).
* Slowpoke: Insert this cow into the line in place of a missing number (for example the 6 can be played between the 5 and the 7) (this card cannot be placed if there are no gaps in the line numbering).

==== Note! ====
A farmer who plays a special cow with 5 flies can, if he wishes, change the direction of play!!! In this case, he takes the MOW card, pointing it left or right as he prefers. The game continues in the direction shown by the arrow.

==== New herd ====
A farmer who CANNOT or DOES NOT WANT to add a cow to the like, takes all the cards in the herd and places them face down in his stable... Then, he starts a new herd by playing a card from his hand to the middle of the table.

Each fly in a stable produces 1 embarrassment point at the end of the game.

=== 2. Draw a card ===
After a farmer has added a card to the herd, he draws a new card from the deck and adds it to his hand.

==== End of a round ====
When a farmer rakes the last card from the deck, the current round is played out until the herd is added to one of the farmers' stables.

'''Then, any cards remaining in a farmer's hand are added to his stable.'''

All the flies in a farmer's stable are added to any scored in previous rounds.

==== End of the game ====
The game ends when a farmer has ammassed more than 100 flies at the end of a round.

The farmer with the fewest flies wins.
